# Classification-models

Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. Classification algorithms in machine learning use input training data to predict the likelihood that subsequent data will fall into one of the predetermined categories. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.

In this, I have used classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes,  Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification.
